# Liam's prework study guide

## Description

The project is a step by step guide for beginners to learn about HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am enrolled on this to improve my knowledge of coding. The study guide was built so I can keep all my notes and tips for the course in one place. Rather than having random notes everywhere, this allows me to have one central place to refer back to.

I learnt so much with regard to Git Hub and how to pull a project onto my local computer to work on it without affecting the main branch. I know how to merge it back to the main branch using pull requests. I learnt about HTML and how to structure a site. CSS is then they way it is styled. Using an external style sheet is a more efficient way of styling projects but you can use inline styling also.

Javascript is very challening! This is where I feel like I need to spend alot of time re reading my notes!
